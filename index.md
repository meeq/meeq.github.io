# Hello

This is the homepage of Christopher Bonhage, a human.

I am a full-stack software engineer with an affinity for retro-computing, open source, web technologies, and building "the simplest thing that could possibly work".

Lately I have been tinkering with homebrew Nintendo 64 development using [LibDragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/).

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meeq64), [GitHub](https://github.com/meeq), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-bonhage-629612136/).
